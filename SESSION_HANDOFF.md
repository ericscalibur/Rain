## What Was Done This Session

Phase 11: Metacognition & Self-Directed Evolution — substantial progress. Built the remaining pieces on top of what was already partially done (tiered escalation, gap detection, relevance-gated memory).

---

## Changes Made This Session

### 1. Fixed `prune_session_memory` schema bug — `rain/memory.py`
- The `INSERT INTO session_facts` call used `fact`/`confidence` columns that don't exist in the schema
- Fixed to use correct columns: `fact_type='compressed_history'`, `fact_key='summary'`, `fact_value=<compressed>`
- This was silently failing and suppressing all deliberate forgetting

### 2. Phase 11 methods — `rain/memory.py`
Three new methods added after `get_top_gaps()`:

**`get_performance_stats()`**
- Queries `feedback` table, returns per-agent accuracy/confidence/counts (all time + rolling 30d)
- Includes synthesis stats from `synthesis_log` and open gap count from `knowledge_gaps`
- Powers `/api/performance` and the CLI `--meta` flag

**`harvest_positive_examples(min_confidence=0.65, limit=200)`**
- Collects `rating='good'`, no correction, `confidence >= threshold` rows
- Returns list ready for JSONL export as positive fine-tuning examples
- Complements the existing corrections export in finetune.py

**`generate_meta_report(model_query_fn)`**
- Calls `get_performance_stats()` + `get_top_gaps()` to build a stats block
- Sends to LLM (llama3.2) with a metacognition prompt requesting: Strengths / Weak areas / Improvement proposals / One-sentence summary
- Falls back to raw stats block if model unavailable

### 3. Phase 11 API endpoints — `server.py`
- `GET /api/performance` — returns `get_performance_stats()` JSON
- `POST /api/finetune/harvest?min_confidence=0.65` — runs `harvest_positive_examples()`, writes to `~/.rain/training/positive_examples.jsonl`
- `GET /api/meta` — runs `generate_meta_report()` via llama3.2, returns `{"report": "...markdown..."}`

### 4. Phase 11 UI — `static/index.html`
- New **Performance** sidebar section (above sidebar footer, below Training)
- Shows: total ratings, overall accuracy, per-agent accuracy (last 30d), synthesis stats, open gap count
- **🧠 Self-Assessment** button — calls `/api/meta`, renders the report in an expandable box in the sidebar

### 5. `--meta` CLI flag — `rain.py`
- `python3 rain.py --meta` — generates and prints the metacognition report, then exits
- Uses llama3.2 directly (same model as server-side)

## Phase 11 Completion Status

**Already built (previous sessions + this session):**
- ✅ Tiered model escalation (`_fast_logic_model`, `_is_simple_logic_query` in orchestrator)
- ✅ Knowledge gap detection + logging + injection into agent prompts
- ✅ Background LLM gap description generation
- ✅ Deliberate forgetting via `prune_session_memory()` (now fixed)
- ✅ Relevance-gated Tier 1 (session summaries — keyword overlap > 0.08)
- ✅ Relevance-gated Tier 3 (semantic search — cosine sim)
- ✅ Relevance-gated Tier 4 (corrections — semantic retrieval)
- ✅ Relevance-gated Tier 5 (session facts — keyword overlap > 0.05; profile always injected)
- ✅ Metacognitive note injection (gap awareness in agent prompts)
- ✅ Performance dashboard (`get_performance_stats` + `/api/performance` + UI panel)
- ✅ Self-generated positive training data (`harvest_positive_examples` + `/api/finetune/harvest`)
- ✅ Metacognition agent (`generate_meta_report` + `/api/meta` + `--meta` CLI flag)
- ✅ Calibration tracking (`get_calibration_factors` in memory.py — per-agent accuracy factors)

**What remains (nice-to-have):**
- Improvement proposals that Rain can write to a file for human review (currently they're inline in the meta report)
- Embedding-based gating for Tier 1 (currently keyword heuristic — more accurate but costs an embed call)
- Context budget tracker (prune lowest-relevance injections when total context grows large)
- Weekly scheduled meta report (cron-style, not yet wired)

Phase 11 is substantially complete. If you consider the must-haves done, update ROADMAP.md to ✅.

## Discussions Worth Preserving

### TurboQuant (Google Research)
Evaluated this session. TurboQuant is KV-cache compression (PolarQuant 3-bit + QJL 1-bit error correction). Claims 6x KV-cache reduction, 8x throughput on H100 GPUs, no accuracy loss, no training required. **Not relevant to Rain today** — Rain runs 3–14B models single-query on M1 16GB; KV cache isn't the bottleneck. Bookmark for Phase 12 if Rain ever runs 70B+ models or multi-user concurrent sessions. Ollama may integrate it automatically in future.

### Tier 3 semantic search gap identified
Current `semantic_search()` has no minimum similarity threshold — top-3 results are always injected regardless of actual relevance score. As memory grows over months, completely irrelevant past exchanges will be injected if they happen to share any embedding direction with the query. Fix: add `min_similarity=0.25` floor to `semantic_search()` call in `_build_memory_context`. Small change, meaningful for long-running instances.

---

## Current State

- Rain server: functional — restart to pick up new endpoints
- All three Python files compile clean (`python3 -m py_compile`)
- Telegram bot: working (`python3 rain-telegram.py`)
- `qwen2.5:14b`: should be fully downloaded now

## Honest Assessment (dictated end of session)

**What works:** Architecture is sound. 6-tier relevance-gated memory is real. Knowledge graph closes codebase hallucination. Phase 11 metacognition gives Rain genuine self-awareness of its weak areas. Telegram, voice, OpenAI-compatible API, web UI — Rain meets you everywhere.

**What's broken:**
- Confidence deflation (53–62% on correct answers) → synthesis fires constantly → 2–4 min response times. Root cause: local models trained for completions, not epistemic calibration. Fix: reflection rubric, not `_score_confidence()`.
- Fine-tuning loop built but never run. `finetune.py --full` has never been executed. All quality improvement to date is prompt-level. No weight updates.
- Tier 3 similarity floor missing — top-3 always injected regardless of score.
- Correction deduplication doesn't exist — 10 corrections about the same mistake = 10 rows, growing noise.
- Tool use reliability patch-worked, not fixed.

**What Rain learned from Claude:** Epistemic calibration is trained not prompted. Consistency across sessions needs values in weights not facts in memory. Short and correct beats long and approximate — bias in local model training toward verbose responses.

**What Rain learned from OpenClaw:** Skills as composable declarative units. Declarative triggers. Skill chaining. Community registry. ClawHub integration is half-wired — finish it.

## What's Next (priority order)

### Immediate (close existing loops)
1. **Run the fine-tuning loop** — `python3 finetune.py --full`. First time Rain's weights reflect its own experience. Highest impact action available.
2. **Fix reflection rubric** — grade on accuracy + epistemic honesty, not structure + completeness. One prompt edit. Fixes confidence deflation, cuts synthesis triggers, fastest responses get faster.
3. **Tier 3 similarity floor** — `min_similarity=0.25` in orchestrator.py `_build_memory_context` semantic_search call. One line.
4. **Correction deduplication** — background job distilling near-duplicate Tier 4 corrections into single authoritative rules.

### Near-term
5. **Phase 12: Sovereign Identity** — `--export`, Nostr keypair, cross-device sync, Lightning micropayments. Makes Rain portable and cryptographically yours.
6. **Finish ClawHub skill ecosystem** — declarative triggers, skill chaining, one-click install from web UI.

### Horizon
7. **Proactive intelligence** — Rain surfaces insights without being asked, via Telegram. Pattern detection across sessions.
8. **Sustained autonomy** — progress persistence for multi-hour tasks, milestone checkpoints, async Telegram notification when done.

Phase 8 (Voice): ✅ Already done — STT via faster-whisper + `/api/transcribe`, TTS via Web Speech API, both toggles in web UI.

## Known Issues (carry-forward)
- Confidence deflation still present (53–62% on correct answers) — reflection prompt fix pending
- Streaming works but synthesis can't stream (falls back to full response)
- Vision slow on first run (model load time)
- GitHub API rate limit at 60 req/hr unauthenticated
- Tier 3 semantic search has no minimum similarity floor (top-3 always injected)

## Eric's Setup
- MacBook Pro M1, 16GB RAM, 712GB free disk
- Ollama installed, Rain server on port 7734
- Telegram bot wired to Rain, working
- Monthly El Salvador tax filing automation planned (~2026-04-30)
